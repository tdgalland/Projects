[THESE ARE BATTERY SCRIPTS!!!]
This is being worked on by a techy dude who goes by the name Dubfiance.
This is intended to be for KDE neon/Kubuntu/or any KDE5 interface or any OS that allows users to put custom scripts to battery profiles.
Everything else is just on you I can't be held responsible.

These are VERY simple battery scripts that are to be applied by adding them to the scrips section of the energy saving settings page.

There are three scripts that are simply named for adding them to the appropriate battery profile.

#-------------------------------------------------------------#
WHAT YOU NEED:
    tuned-adm (Required)
    qdbus (Probably already installed, but it's good to check)

Copy this into terminal: sudo apt install tuned-adm qdbus
#-------------------------------------------------------------#

AC - AC script. Enables compositing and puts computer in the throughput-performance energy profile.

BN - Battery Normal script or normal battery use. Enables compositing and puts computer in the laptop-battery-powersave energy profile.

BL - Battery Low script. Disables compositing and puts computer in the laptop-battery-powersave energy profile.

Yea I think that's it for me here. Good luck.

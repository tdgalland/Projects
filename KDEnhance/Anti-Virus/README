[THIS IS A DOWNLOAD SCANNER CHECKER!!!]
This is being worked on by a techy dude who goes by the name Dubfiance.
This is intended to be for KDE neon/Kubuntu/or any KDE5 interface.
Everything else is just on you I can't be held responsible.

This is a scanning script that I modified from the internet to now include:
    -Changed popups to notifications
    -Different notifications for safe/infected files
    -A scanning prompt for files over 25MB
    -Hides all files required so it works in the background
    -Clears virus-quarantine for each login
    
The original article that I modified the script from is here:

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
WHAT YOU NEED:
    clamav (Required)
    inotifywait (Required)
    clamdscan (Required)
    notify-send (Required)

Copy this into terminal: sudo apt install clamav inotifywait clamdscan notify-send
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Put this script into autostart in KDE settings as an application. Logout/Login and now you will get notified for all downloads if your download is safe or viruses are found.

All detected viruses will end up in ~/.virus-quarantine, so if it detects something, check there.

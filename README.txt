Thanks for checking out my resource pack! Should work under 1.16.4.

A few things to note, For best results, well my favorite result that plays nicely with this pack, in your video settings change attack indicator from crosshair/OFF to hotbar!

If you do not like the thinner XP/Horse Stamina bar, there is a thicker version under assets/minecraft/textures/gui called icons.png.old switch the names between icons.png to enable it and reselect the resource pack in minecraft's resource page to get it going. This version does have a slight cutout for the levels to hopefully make it seem better.

If you find the fishing hook hard to see, remove .old on fishing_hook.png in assets/minecraft/textures/entity and place it on the current fishing hook.


Degredation artwork done by Danjim and Zander. Other modifications and Code done by me!

This is pre-release, so please don't share this pack just yet, there are still updates that need to be done!

Also I'd like to thank VanillaTweaks.net for inspiration for some parts of this pack, this helped me tweak it to better fit the pack and minecraft in general! Go check out their website for way more specific tweaks c:

I will need to rewrite some code since some are directly imported as of currently... Most newer updates are imported from the website and will need to be rewritten, they have a lot of great ideas.
